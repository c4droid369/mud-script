My personal mud script for [pkuxkx](https://www.pkuxkx.net)

** Start to play
You should install [paotin++](https://github.com/mudclient/paotin), recommend to use beta branch.<br>
Clone this repo, set it to paotin/var, recommend to use symlink, create ids and log directory.<br>
Linux can be run by paotin-start and enter `start MUD_ID` to start, Windows recommend to use docker, as [paotin README.md](https://github.com/mudclient/paotin/tree/beta?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F%E4%B8%8B) says.
